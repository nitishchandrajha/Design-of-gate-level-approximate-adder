# Design-of-gate-level-approximate-adder
Overview
This project explores the design and optimization of a Gate-Level Approximate Adder for FPGA implementation. The focus is on reducing power consumption, area, and delay while maintaining sufficient computational accuracy, making it suitable for error-tolerant applications such as image processing, machine learning, and signal processing.
Key Features
Implementation of Static Approximate Adders (SAA)

Design of HERLOA (Hybrid Error Reduction Lower Part OR Adder) and a proposed optimized adder

FPGA implementation using Xilinx Artix-7 and Vivado 2018.3

Performance comparison of accurate vs. approximate adders
